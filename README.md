Single-user personal accounting Perl web-app


Old code
========

Poorly-maintained ancient code. I wrote it a long time ago (2001?) and barely maintain it.


Setup
=====

Create the database as listed in database.sql and make a db user and password.

Put this entire directory in a cgi-bin location and protect it with HTTP Basic Auth.

Make copies of the *.template files without the .template, and edit them to suit.
